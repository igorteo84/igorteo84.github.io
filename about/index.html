	<h1>About me</h1>
	Currently pursuing a PhD in Economics at Rice University, he is also adjunct professor of the 
	Center of Energy and Environment at the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administraci√≥n (IESA) in Caracas, Venezuela (on leave).
	His recent research concerns the study of regulations in the oil and gas sector. 
	Previously, I have studied the performance of national oil companies and the role of fossil fuel exports in economic diversification.
	I have also worked as adjunct director of the Center of Energy and Environment at IESA, and as a consultant on projects 
	related to energy subsidies and opportunities for services companies in the oil sector. 
	I have also served as an external director for investing groups focused on the petrochemicals industry, and 
	also have experience in the financial sector in Venezuela.
